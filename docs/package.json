  "description": "This project was made while experimenting with TypeScript and es6. The idea is to have an NCSoft Lineage 2 client library, that allows other projects to build L2 client functionalities (like bots, game helpers, etc.) on top of it. It can be also used as a framework for building Lineage2 automated tests for L2 private servers.",
